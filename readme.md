# x2tester wrapper

Wrapper of the x2t test utility

## Getting start

For local startup in developer mode,
recommended installing a local `bundle config` file.

```shell
  bundle config set --local with development
```

Afterwards install the dependencies with the bundle.

```shell
  bundle install
```

### Private fonts as a submodule

The x2ttester run uses fonts from a private repository.
You can install them as a `member` of ONLYOFFICE-QA and must have `ssh` access to the repository set up.

```shell
  git submodule update --init --recursive
```
